# GenAI Chatbot – Flask-based Prompt Analysis System

# Overview
GenAI Chatbot is an intelligent prompt analysis system built using Python and the Flask web framework, with an integrated API system. It is designed to interact with users via a chatbot interface, interpret a wide range of input prompts, and deliver structured analytical responses.

The core of this application lies in its backend logic, tailored to perform prompt understanding and response generation through general AI (GenAI) techniques. Though currently operating with an estimated 60% accuracy, it lays a solid foundation for scalable and intelligent AI-driven applications.

🚀 Features
🌐 API Integration: Seamlessly supports API-based input and output communication, making it modular and extensible.

🧩 Prompt Analysis Engine: Processes user prompts to extract intent, semantic patterns, and context.

⚙️ Backend-Powered Logic: Flask-based backend efficiently routes queries, performs analysis, and returns responses.

📊 Response Accuracy Reporting: Provides performance benchmarking with a baseline of 60% accuracy in real-world scenarios.

🧪 Technical Implementation
🔍 Prompt Analysis
Uses a structured NLP pipeline to tokenize, normalize, and contextualize user inputs.

Implements rule-based and pattern-matching logic to interpret prompt semantics.

Designed with future integration capabilities for machine learning or transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT) to enhance interpretation depth.

⚙️ Flask Backend
RESTful API endpoints are built using Flask, allowing flexible deployment and testing.

Supports POST and GET methods to send and retrieve analyzed data.

Handles input validation, JSON response formatting, and error logging.

📡 API System
Allows third-party systems or frontend interfaces to integrate via a standardized API.

Accepts prompt data, processes via backend, and returns JSON-formatted analysis results.

Secure and scalable for local or remote deployments.

📈 Performance & Accuracy
While this chatbot currently operates at ~60% accuracy based on internal benchmarks and heuristic evaluation, performance is dependent on:

Prompt complexity and structure

Vocabulary and domain relevance

Algorithmic interpretation and logic flow

The goal is to iterate on the logic and gradually integrate ML-powered models to enhance:

Accuracy in intent detection

Depth of natural language understanding (NLU)

Relevance and clarity of generated responses
